# Memory

## Me
Philippe, independent iOS developer building consumer apps. Professional but friendly tone. Concise and actionable docs preferred.

## Projects
| Name | What |
|------|------|
| **AquaLog** | iOS hydration tracker — tap to log water, ring chart progress toward 8 glasses. SwiftUI + SwiftData, iOS 17+, single-screen MVP. |

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI for UI
- SwiftData for local persistence (iOS 17+)
- No cloud sync, no accounts for MVP
- Xcode, iPhone target only (no iPad for v1)

## Current Focus
Building AquaLog MVP over 2 weekends (~20–24 hrs). PRD and roadmap complete. Next step: start coding.

## Preferences
- Keep documents concise and actionable
- Professional but friendly tone
- Solo developer — no team coordination overhead
